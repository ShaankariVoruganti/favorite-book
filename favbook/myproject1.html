When a strange blight comes over the land and the animals fall into a deep sleep, Anna is convinced she can help find the cure.
 It needs to be done quickly because the food supply is in danger and Elsa will soon be departing on her grand tour.
 After Anna finds a magic door in the castle she never knew about, it leads her to a secret room where she finds magic books,
 herbs, and other mysterious items. The clue might be hidden within this room and Anna is convinced she can solve this mystery,
but once a spell is cast, she finds herself and the entire kingdom of Arendelle in more danger than she could have ever imagined.

What a delicious, magical adventure! I wasn’t sure what to expect with this middle-grade novel, but it’s so wonderfully written.
 It’s always lovely when you take a chance on a book and it turns out to be just what you were looking for.
 I often find that some middle-grade books tend to drag in parts which affects my interest levels during reading.
 This book is action-packed and there’s always something new, but there were a few events in the story 
 that were just a tad bit drawn out for me–very rarely though.

The author has done an excellent job writing the characters’ personalities and stayed true to the original movie.
<q><!--q element defines a short quotation-->
 Olaf, Kristoff, and Oaken were hilarious, and it was nice that the author put in some fresh characters too.</q> 
 This is supposed to be the ‘in between’ from Frozen to Frozen 2.</p>
<section><p><!--this defines sections i/ a document and divides document into sections and subsections-->
One of my favorite aspects of Frozen is the family theme; I love the caring sister relationship between Anna and Elsa.
In Forest of Shadows, Anna has a few insecurities: she’s missing the inseparable relationship she once had with Elsa 
 and seeks approval from her, but she soon discovers that the real issue is within herself. The heart of the story really revolves around Anna.
 I loved that true love came into play as in the original film, but also the message of facing your fears and accepting them. 
 There are so many wonderful, positive messages in the book.

<p><strong>New Characters In FROZEN2:</strong>
<ul><!--this creates unordered list of the elements-->
<li><h2><i>Queen Iduna</i></h2></li>
<picture><!--it allows to specify several images -->
<center><img src="https://d23.com/app/uploads/2019/11/780w-463h_111819_meet-the-frozen-2-characters-2-1-768x456.jpg"></center></picture>
<p>
Queen Iduna—voiced by Frozen 2 newcomer Evan Rachel Wood—is 
back, but this time with secrets from the past. With young Elsa’s
 powers growing, Iduna wonders if her past holds some answers for
 Elsa’s future. Director Jennifer Lee said Wood’s voice was 
 perfect for the role as Wood’s voice sounds as if she’s keeping
 something hidden at all times. Her singing voice also sits right
 between Kristen Bell (Anna) and Idina Menzel’s (Elsa) own singing 
voices, which is perfect for her beautiful lullaby “All is Found.”</p>
<li><h2><i>King Agnarr</i></h2></li>

<p>
Like Queen Iduna, Anna and Elsa’s father also returns—voiced by 
Alfred Molina. He tries his best to help Elsa as her powers grow,
 and his love for his daughters is infinite.</p>
 <li><h2><i>Bruni</i></h2></li>

 <p>
 Meet your cute new obsession—because he’s most definitely ours!
 Bruni is a curious salamander who meets Anna and Elsa during their
 journey. He also takes a liking to Elsa’s icy snowflakes
 because—wait for it—the cold never bothered him anyways</p>
 <li><h2><i>Yelana</i></h2></li>
 <picture><center><img src="https://d23.com/app/uploads/2019/11/780w-463h_111819_meet-the-frozen-2-characters-6-1-768x456.jpg"></center>
 </picture><p>
 As the leader of the Northuldra, Yelana is extremely wise 
 and fiercely protective when it comes to her community.
 While weary of outsiders, if one shows an understanding
 of the forest and its inhabitants, Yelana is known to soften.</p>
<li><h2><i>The Nokk</i></h2></li>
<picture><center><img src="https://d23.com/app/uploads/2019/11/gale-wind.gif"></center>
</picture><p>
Pulling from Nordic folklore, the Frozen 2 filmmakers were able
 to create this beautiful character, a mythical water spirit that 
 takes the form of a stallion. While gorgeous, this water spirit
 is a warrior set to guard the secrets of the forest and is dangerous to those not careful.</p>
<li><h2><i>Earth Giants</i></h2></li>
<picture><center><img src="https://d23.com/app/uploads/2019/11/elsa-ice.gif"></center>
</picture><p>
Also known as the earth spirits, these massive creatures are
 capable of incredible destruction and create a feeling of unease
 across the enchanted forest, but when they are asleep, they appear as rocky riverbanks.</p>
